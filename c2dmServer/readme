This is a simple ruby app to send a c2dm message to your android device that has already been registered for push notification.
It mimics a web server to send a c2dm message using the c2dm ruby gem.

To use, first get the regId from your emulator or device (use log.d or something), then modify config.yml and fill in the appropriate fields.
Then simply run `ruby sendC2DM.rb "_message_text_"` to send a c2dm message
